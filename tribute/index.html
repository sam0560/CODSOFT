          He (Ronaldo) does things I have never seen from any other player, and
          it is marvellous to watch. It takes a great player to grab the bull by
          the horns and make things happen, but he has done it repeatedly.

            Cristiano Ronaldo, born February 5, 1985, is a legendary Portuguese
            footballer. Starting at Sporting CP, he moved to Manchester United
            in 2003, winning multiple titles. In 2009, he joined Real Madrid,
            becoming their top scorer and winning four Champions League titles
            and Ballon d'Or awards. After playing for Juventus and returning to
            Manchester United, he now plays for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia.
